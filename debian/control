Description: Utility for managing Conky configuration files
 Conky-manager2 is a utility to manage themes and configurations for
 Conky, a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays
 information such as text, icons, progress bars and graph widgets on
 your desktop. Conky-manager2 is a fork of the original Conky Manager
 by teejee2008 (Tony George), but provides support for the newer
 Lua-based configuration files of Conky version 1.10.
